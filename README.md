### ðŸ“„ Abstract

This study investigates the behavioral effects of free credit incentives on consumer spending on platforms like Zepto. Drawing on principles from behavioral economics such as present bias, habit formation, and loss aversion, we examine whether these incentives create sustained user engagement or only produce short-term responses. Using primary survey data from app users, the analysis employs a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimation strategy to compare spending behavior before and after the withdrawal of free cash offers.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Research Question

Do free credit incentives offered by instant delivery apps have a lasting impact on consumer engagement, or does the effect diminish once the offers are withdrawn?

### ðŸ”¬ Methodology

To identify the causal effect of free cash incentives, this study uses a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** quasi-experimental design. The approach compares changes in spending behavior over time between a treatment group (users who received incentives) and a control group. The analysis is based on primary data collected from respondents.

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

The results indicate that while free cash incentives may initially prompt an increase in user spending, this effect is short-lived. The withdrawal of these offers **did not produce a statistically significant decline** in reported consumption[cite: 218]. [cite_start]This suggests that the long-term retention of customers may not rely solely on such promotional offers. The coefficient for the DiD interaction term was statistically insignificant (p=0.978).

###  Tools Used

The econometric analysis was conducted using the following tools:
* **Language/Software:** R (in R Studio) 
* **R Packages:** `dplyr` for data manipulation, `readxl` for data import, and `broom` for tidying model outputs.
